By sending a specially crafted request, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a crash or memory contents to be sent to the peer. This issue affects applications that directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of supported client protocols. The function is typically used by TLS applications that support ALPN or NPN. ALPN is significantly more widely deployed than NPN. The vulnerability can lead to a loss of confidentiality, as up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory may be sent to the peer. However, this scenario is not typically under attacker control and requires a configuration or programming error in the calling application. The severity of this issue is assessed as Low, as it is most likely to affect applications using NPN instead of ALPN, which is not widely used.

By sending a specially crafted request, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a crash or memory contents to be sent to the peer. This issue affects applications that directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of supported client protocols. The function is typically used by TLS applications that support ALPN or NPN. ALPN is significantly more widely deployed than NPN. The vulnerability can lead to a loss of confidentiality, as up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory may be sent to the peer. However, this scenario is not typically under attacker control and requires a configuration or programming error in the calling application. The severity of this issue is assessed as Low, as it is most likely to affect applications using NPN instead of ALPN, which is not widely used. Active exploitation is unlikely due to the lack of attacker control. The FIPS modules in versions 3.3, 3.2, 3.1, and 3.0 are not affected. No new releases of OpenSSL are issued at this time, and the fix will be included in the next releases. Impact: The vulnerability in OpenSSL can be exploited by a remote attacker to cause a denial of service by crashing the application or sending memory contents to the peer. This can result in unexpected application behavior, a crash, or a loss of confidentiality. Up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory may be exposed to the peer. However, this vulnerability only affects applications that directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of supported client protocols.

Applications that use these functions to check DSA public keys or parameters may experience long delays, potentially leading to a denial of service. The issue arises when checking excessively long DSA keys or parameters obtained from an untrusted source. The computations performed by these functions can be slow if the modulus (p parameter) is too large. Although OpenSSL restricts the use of public keys with a modulus over 10,000 bits for signature verification, the key and parameter check functions do not enforce this limit. Only applications directly calling these functions or using the OpenSSL pkey and pkeyparam command line applications with the -check option are vulnerable. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected, but the OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are. Impact: A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause long delays in applications that use the EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() functions, potentially resulting in a denial of service. This can occur when checking DSA public keys or parameters obtained from an untrusted source.

These vulnerabilities include a use-after-free flaw in the SSL_free_buffers API function, incorrect handling of TLSv1.3 sessions, checking excessively long DSA keys or parameters, and certain memory operations in a rarely-used API. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending specially crafted requests or manipulating certain API functions. The impact of these vulnerabilities ranges from arbitrary code execution and denial of service to information disclosure. The affected versions include libssl-dev 1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.23, libssl-doc 1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.23, libssl1.1 1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.23, and openssl 1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.23.

By sending a specially crafted request, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a crash or memory contents to be sent to the peer. This issue affects applications that directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of supported client protocols. The function is typically used by TLS applications that support ALPN or NPN. ALPN is significantly more widely deployed than NPN. The vulnerability can lead to a loss of confidentiality, as up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory may be sent to the peer. However, this scenario is not typically under attacker control and requires a configuration or programming error in the calling application. The severity of this issue is assessed as Low, as it is most likely to affect applications using NPN instead of ALPN, which is not widely used.

Impact: If these vulnerabilities are exploited, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the system, cause a denial of service condition, or obtain sensitive information. This could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, system crashes, and loss of confidentiality. AdditionalInformation: These vulnerabilities have been assigned CVE-2024-2511, CVE-2024-4603, CVE-2024-4741, and CVE-2024-5535. The impact severity varies depending on the specific vulnerability, with some being more critical than others. The OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is particularly affected, and applications using NPN instead of ALPN are more likely to be vulnerable. However, active exploitation is unlikely due to the specific conditions required for successful attacks. The FIPS modules in versions 3.3, 3.2, 3.1, and 3.0 are not affected by these vulnerabilities.

By exploiting certain server configurations, an attacker can cause unbounded memory growth, resulting in a denial of service condition. This vulnerability affects TLS servers supporting TLSv1.3 and does not affect TLS clients. The FIPS modules in versions 3.2, 3.1, and 3.0, as well as OpenSSL 1.0.2, are not affected. Impact: An attacker can exploit certain server configurations to trigger unbounded memory growth, leading to a denial of service. This can occur in TLSv1.3 if the non-default SSL_OP_NO_TICKET option is used (excluding when early_data support is also configured and the default anti-replay protection is in use). Under specific conditions, the session cache can enter an incorrect state and fail to flush properly, causing it to grow in an unbounded manner. A malicious client can intentionally create this scenario to force a denial of service, or it may occur accidentally during normal operation.

Applications that use these functions to check DSA public keys or parameters may experience long delays, potentially leading to a denial of service. The issue arises when checking excessively long DSA keys or parameters obtained from an untrusted source. The computations performed by these functions can be slow if the modulus (p parameter) is too large. Although OpenSSL restricts the use of public keys with a modulus over 10,000 bits for signature verification, the key and parameter check functions do not enforce this limit. Only applications directly calling these functions or using the OpenSSL pkey and pkeyparam command line applications with the -check option are vulnerable. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected, but the OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are. Impact: A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause long delays in applications that use the EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() functions, potentially resulting in a denial of service. This can occur when checking DSA public keys or parameters obtained from an untrusted source. By supplying excessively long DSA keys or parameters, the attacker can cause the computations performed by these functions to take a long time, leading to delays in the applications execution.

By sending a specially crafted request, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a crash or memory contents to be sent to the peer. This issue affects applications that directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of supported client protocols. The function is typically used by TLS applications that support ALPN or NPN. ALPN is significantly more widely deployed than NPN. The vulnerability can lead to a loss of confidentiality, as up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory may be sent to the peer. However, this scenario is not typically under attacker control and requires a configuration or programming error in the calling application. The severity of this issue is assessed as Low, as it is most likely to affect applications using NPN instead of ALPN, which is not widely used. Active exploitation is unlikely due to the lack of attacker control. The FIPS modules in versions 3.3, 3.2, 3.1, and 3.0 are not affected. No new releases of OpenSSL are issued at this time, and the fix will be included in the next releases. Impact: The vulnerability in OpenSSL can be exploited by a remote attacker to cause a denial of service by crashing the application or sending memory contents to the peer. This can result in unexpected application behavior, a crash, or a loss of confidentiality. Up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory may be exposed to the peer. However, this vulnerability only affects applications that directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of supported client protocols. The severity of this issue is assessed as Low, as it requires a configuration or programming error in the calling application and is unlikely to be actively exploited.

This issue arises due to a timing signal of approximately 300 nanoseconds when the top word of the inverted ECDSA nonce value is zero, which occurs with significant probability for certain elliptic curves, particularly the NIST P-521 curve. Exploitation requires either local access to the signing application or a very fast, low-latency network connection. The vulnerability affects FIPS modules in OpenSSL versions 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1, and 3.0. Impact: If exploited, this vulnerability could allow an attacker to recover private key information, potentially compromising the confidentiality of cryptographic operations. The risk is mitigated by the requirement for local access or a high-speed, low-latency network connection. AdditionalInformation: The vulnerability is classified as having a low severity due to the specific conditions required for successful exploitation. It was discovered by George Pantelakis and Alicja Kario. Remediation: Apply the latest patches and updates provided by the respective vendors. [Generated by AI];04/24/2025;10.02.2025;TPE;openssl
Low;3.10.2025 20:13;24.04.2025 19:42;162;Open;Low;i-0c429d129f6de338d;;10.03.2025;Attention Required: vulnerabilities in Openssl;Summary: OpenSSL contains a vulnerability (CVE-2024-9143) in its low-level GF(2^m) elliptic curve APIs, specifically when handling untrusted explicit values for the field polynomial. This flaw can lead to out-of-bounds memory reads or writes, potentially causing application crashes or enabling remote code execution. The affected APIs include EC_GROUP_new_curve_GF2m(), EC_GROUP_new_from_params(), and various BN_GF2m_*() functions. Applications using exotic explicit binary (GF(2^m)) curve parameters that allow invalid field polynomials with a zero constant term are susceptible to this issue. However, protocols using named curves or X9.62 encoding for binary curves are not vulnerable, reducing the likelihood of exploitation. Impact: Exploitation of this vulnerability could result in application crashes or remote code execution, posing risks to system integrity and availability. The likelihood of exploitation is low due to the limited use of exotic curve encodings. AdditionalInformation: The FIPS modules in versions 3.3, 3.2, 3.1, and 3.0 are confirmed not to be affected by this vulnerability. Applications processing X.509 certificates are also not susceptible due to the use of X9.62 encoding. Remediation: Apply the latest patches and updates provided by the respective vendors.

This issue arises from improper quoting of path names when creating virtual environments, allowing an attacker to inject commands into the activation scripts (e.g., source venv/bin/activate). This vulnerability enables arbitrary command execution when the virtual environment is activated. Virtual environments not created by an attacker or not activated before use (e.g., ./venv/bin/python) are unaffected. Impact: Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands, potentially compromising the system where the virtual environment is activated. AdditionalInformation: This vulnerability specifically affects the activation scripts of virtual environments created with the CPython `venv` module. It does not impact virtual environments that are not activated or are created in a secure manner. Remediation: Apply the latest patches and updates provided by the respective vendors.
