This vulnerability arises from improper handling of deeply nested JSON structures during serialization and deserialization. Deserialization methods, such as JsonConvert.DeserializeObject, can cause high CPU and RAM usage, while serialization methods, like JsonConvert.SerializeObject, may trigger a StackOverflow exception. Exploitation requires highly nested input, with nesting levels exceeding 10 million for significant latency or around 20,000 for StackOverflow exceptions. Impact: Exploitation of this vulnerability can result in Denial of Service (DoS), causing high resource consumption or application crashes. This can be triggered remotely by unauthenticated attackers, potentially affecting any application using the library. AdditionalInformation: The vulnerability affects all applications using Newtonsoft.Json, not limited to IIS environments.

Applications that use these functions to check DSA public keys or parameters may experience long delays, potentially leading to a denial of service. The issue arises when checking excessively long DSA keys or parameters obtained from an untrusted source. The computations performed by these functions can be slow if the modulus (p parameter) is too large. Although OpenSSL restricts the use of public keys with a modulus over 10,000 bits for signature verification, the key and parameter check functions do not enforce this limit. Only applications directly calling these functions or using the OpenSSL pkey and pkeyparam command line applications with the -check option are vulnerable. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected, but the OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are. Impact: A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause long delays in applications that use the EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() functions, potentially resulting in a denial of service.

By sending a specially crafted request, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a crash or memory contents to be sent to the peer. This issue affects applications that directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of supported client protocols. The function is typically used by TLS applications that support ALPN or NPN. ALPN is significantly more widely deployed than NPN. The vulnerability can lead to a loss of confidentiality, as up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory may be sent to the peer. However, this scenario is not typically under attacker control and requires a configuration or programming error in the calling application. The severity of this issue is assessed as Low, as it is most likely to affect applications using NPN instead of ALPN, which is not widely used. Active exploitation is unlikely due to the lack of attacker control. The FIPS modules in versions 3.3, 3.2, 3.1, and 3.0 are not affected. No new releases of OpenSSL are issued at this time, and the fix will be included in the next releases. Impact: The vulnerability in OpenSSL can be exploited by a remote attacker to cause a denial of service by crashing the application or sending memory contents to the peer. This can result in unexpected application behavior, a crash, or a loss of confidentiality. Up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory may be exposed to the peer. However, this vulnerability only affects applications that directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of supported client protocols.
