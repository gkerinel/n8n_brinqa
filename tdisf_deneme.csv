This vulnerability arises from improper handling of deeply nested JSON structures during serialization and deserialization. Deserialization methods, such as JsonConvert.DeserializeObject, can cause high CPU and RAM usage, while serialization methods, like JsonConvert.SerializeObject, may trigger a StackOverflow exception. Exploitation requires highly nested input, with nesting levels exceeding 10 million for significant latency or around 20,000 for StackOverflow exceptions. Impact: Exploitation of this vulnerability can result in Denial of Service (DoS), causing high resource consumption or application crashes. This can be triggered remotely by unauthenticated attackers, potentially affecting any application using the library. AdditionalInformation: The vulnerability affects all applications using Newtonsoft.Json, not limited to IIS environments.

The issue arises from the failure to restore non-volatile XMM registers after processing data larger than 64 bytes, potentially leading to application state corruption. This vulnerability could result in incorrect application calculations, crashes, or denial of service, and in rare cases, complete control of the application process. The POLY1305 MAC is commonly used in CHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD cipher, frequently employed in TLS protocols 1.2 and 1.3. Impact: Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to application state corruption, resulting in incorrect calculations, crashes, denial of service, or potentially complete control of the application process. The severity is considered low due to the limited scope of affected applications. Workaround: The AVX512-IFMA instructions support can be disabled at runtime by setting the environment variable OPENSSL_ia32cap=:~0x200000. AdditionalInformation: The FIPS provider is not affected by this issue. No specific applications have been identified as impacted by this vulnerability.

This issue arises due to a timing signal of approximately 300 nanoseconds when the top word of the inverted ECDSA nonce value is zero, which occurs with significant probability for certain elliptic curves, particularly the NIST P-521 curve. Exploitation requires either local access to the signing application or a very fast, low-latency network connection. The vulnerability affects FIPS modules in OpenSSL versions 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1, and 3.0. Impact: If exploited, this vulnerability could allow an attacker to recover private key information, potentially compromising the confidentiality of cryptographic operations. The risk is mitigated by the requirement for local access or a high-speed, low-latency network connection. AdditionalInformation: The vulnerability is classified as having a low severity due to the specific conditions required for successful exploitation.

Although OpenSSL restricts the use of public keys with a modulus over 10,000 bits for signature verification, the key and parameter check functions do not enforce this limit.

The issue arises when checking excessively long DSA keys or parameters obtained from an untrusted source.

This issue affects applications that directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of supported client protocols. The function is typically used by TLS applications that support ALPN or NPN. ALPN is significantly more widely deployed than NPN. The vulnerability can lead to a loss of confidentiality, as up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory may be sent to the peer. However, this scenario is not typically under attacker control and requires a configuration or programming error in the calling application. The severity of this issue is assessed as Low, as it is most likely to affect applications using NPN instead of ALPN, which is not widely used.

The issue arises when checking excessively long DSA keys or parameters obtained from an untrusted source. The computations performed by these functions can be slow if the modulus (p parameter) is too large. Although OpenSSL restricts the use of public keys with a modulus over 10,000 bits for signature verification, the key and parameter check functions do not enforce this limit.

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending specially crafted requests or manipulating certain API functions. The impact of these vulnerabilities ranges from arbitrary code execution and denial of service to information disclosure.

However, this scenario is not typically under attacker control and requires a configuration or programming error in the calling application. The severity of this issue is assessed as Low, as it is most likely to affect applications using NPN instead of ALPN, which is not widely used. Active exploitation is unlikely due to the lack of attacker control. The FIPS modules in versions 3.3, 3.2, 3.1, and 3.0 are not affected. No new releases of OpenSSL are issued at this time, and the fix will be included in the next releases. Impact: The vulnerability in OpenSSL can be exploited by a remote attacker to cause a denial of service by crashing the application or sending memory contents to the peer. This can result in unexpected application behavior, a crash, or a loss of confidentiality. Up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory may be exposed to the peer. However, this vulnerability only affects applications that directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of supported client protocols. The severity of this issue is assessed as Low, as it requires a configuration or programming error in the calling application and is unlikely to be actively exploited.

Applications that use these functions to check DSA public keys or parameters may experience long delays, potentially leading to a denial of service. The issue arises when checking excessively long DSA keys or parameters obtained from an untrusted source. The computations performed by these functions can be slow if the modulus (p parameter) is too large. Although OpenSSL restricts the use of public keys with a modulus over 10,000 bits for signature verification, the key and parameter check functions do not enforce this limit. Only applications directly calling these functions or using the OpenSSL pkey and pkeyparam command line applications with the -check option are vulnerable. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected, but the OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are.
