Notably, CVE-2025-48384 involves improper handling of configuration values, where trailing carriage return and line feed characters are stripped, potentially leading to incorrect submodule checkouts and unintended execution of scripts. CVE-2025-48385 describes a protocol injection flaw during repository cloning, allowing arbitrary code execution. Other vulnerabilities include CVE-2025-27613 and CVE-2025-27614, which involve Gitks handling of file modifications and arguments, potentially enabling arbitrary file creation or script execution. CVE-2025-46835 highlights a flaw in Git GUI that could allow overwriting writable files. These issues affect various Git versions and have been addressed in subsequent updates. Impact: Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to arbitrary code execution, unauthorized file creation or modification, and potential security breaches, posing significant risks to affected systems. AdditionalInformation: The vulnerabilities are associated with specific CVE identifiers, including CVE-2025-48384, CVE-2025-48385, CVE-2025-27613, CVE-2025-27614, and CVE-2025-46835. Affected Git versions are below 2.50.1, with fixes available in later versions. Administrators should review the CVE details for comprehensive technical insights. Remediation: Apply the latest patches and updates provided by the respective vendors. [Generated by AI]"",pmieuirlsis30.pmintl.net,,08/27/2025,10/03/2025,TPE,,,,,,,,git-scm git,1562092342772383744,"

This flaw can lead to out-of-bounds memory reads or writes, potentially causing application crashes or enabling remote code execution. The affected APIs include EC_GROUP_new_curve_GF2m(), EC_GROUP_new_from_params(), and various BN_GF2m_*() functions. Applications using exotic explicit binary (GF(2^m)) curve parameters that allow invalid field polynomials with a zero constant term are susceptible to this issue. However, protocols using named curves or X9.62 encoding for binary curves are not vulnerable, reducing the likelihood of exploitation. Impact: Exploitation of this vulnerability could result in application crashes or remote code execution, posing risks to system integrity and availability. The likelihood of exploitation is low due to the limited use of exotic curve encodings. AdditionalInformation: The FIPS modules in versions 3.3, 3.2, 3.1, and 3.0 are confirmed not to be affected by this vulnerability. Applications processing X.509 certificates are also not susceptible due to the use of X9.62 encoding. Remediation: Apply the latest patches and updates provided by the respective vendors.

This issue arises from improper quoting of path names when creating virtual environments, allowing an attacker to inject commands into the activation scripts (e.g., source venv/bin/activate). This vulnerability enables arbitrary command execution when the virtual environment is activated. Virtual environments not created by an attacker or not activated before use (e.g., ./venv/bin/python) are unaffected. Impact: Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands, potentially compromising the system where the virtual environment is activated. AdditionalInformation: This vulnerability specifically affects the activation scripts of virtual environments created with the CPython `venv` module. It does not impact virtual environments that are not activated or are created in a secure manner. Remediation: Apply the latest patches and updates provided by the respective vendors.
